# Next Actions

## Now
- [x] Create `codex/studio-ui-polish-v1.0.7`, record the Chinese design/plan, add RED coverage, and pass the Node plus production-build baseline.
- [x] Implement result-first layout and common conversation/composer alignment.
- [x] Implement control consolidation, copy clarification, semantic radii and restrained emphasis.
- [x] Apply screenshot follow-ups for compact results, image-corner actions, stable menus, neutral favorites, history cards, metadata placement and accidental image-drag protection.
- [x] Replace the over-broad internal-image drag ban with a 180ms deliberate-hold guard while preserving native drag-to-reference behavior.
- [x] Run the full Node/build/size/release and HTTP-static matrix without a paid upstream request.
- [ ] Refresh `http://127.0.0.1:14260/` and manually accept the real rendered/clicked UI; do not package, sync G:, push, merge, or publish first.

## Handoff Notes
- Start here: refresh `http://127.0.0.1:14260/` and manually inspect product commit `16b960c`, especially quick image movement versus press-then-drag, a portrait single result, neutral empty/filled favorites, history grid/list cards, menus, direct mask editing and narrow layout.
- Do not redo: the screenshot-driven UI implementation, drag-intent tests, 133/133 Node suite, size/build, 33/33 release gate, compile/diff check or HTTP static smoke unless product code changes.
- Verify next: confirm quick image movement stays a click, holding about 180ms then dragging still adds a reference, the result image has no filename or thin edge, shared dimensions sit in the completion row, menus dismiss reliably, and history actions do not overlap. Automatic browser automation cannot perform this loopback gate.
- Do not claim: branch merge, push, tag, pull request, GitHub Release, or deletion/cleanup of the worktree/branch has occurred.
- Release boundary: no v1.0.7 ZIP or synchronized folder exists. G: remains unchanged. The temporary manual service is PID `56600` on port `14260`; stop only that exact process after acceptance.
- Current Studio assets: `index-DVmZ99xD.js` and `index-BmiGLwyN.css`.
- Known limits: automatic real-browser smoke is blocked by enterprise loopback policy; mask boundaries remain prompt guidance rather than pixel-perfect constraints; mask binaries are not restored after page refresh; custom gateways must support edits multipart `image[]` and `mask`.

## Prior Release Context
- Historical start point: `I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen`, branch `main`.
- Synced copy on this machine: `G:\doc\Tools\AI产出工具插件\美术\特效组\网页生图工具\NM_web_imagen`.
- Current v1.0.5 packages: local `I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen-v1.0.5.zip`, share `G:\doc\Tools\AI产出工具插件\美术\特效组\网页生图工具\NM_web_imagen-v1.0.5.zip`, SHA256 `7c8e671fb1c00141243cd84427b0c202e9e2be9e8ef23d9537c93787fbe77109`.
- GitHub Release: `https://github.com/Cherofre/NM_web_imagen/releases/tag/v1.0.5`.
- Do not redo: Studio frontend scaffold, `/classic` fallback, real chat endpoints, backend Studio session persistence, GPT chat-model controls, reference snapshot display, and user-turn action buttons are already implemented and committed.
- Verify next after changes:
  - `python "C:\Users\mumengfei\.cc-switch\skills\project-ledger-loop\scripts\check_ledger.py" "I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen"`
  - `git status --short --branch`
- Do not claim: v1.0.5 feature branch was deleted locally or remotely; it is preserved for now.
- Current review evidence: final one-click release passed on `main` on 2026-06-26 17:33 +08:00; local and G: zips share SHA256 `7c8e671fb1c00141243cd84427b0c202e9e2be9e8ef23d9537c93787fbe77109`; final post-fix subagent Important finding is fixed.
- Current queue bug evidence: the stuck second task was a real upstream request that eventually timed out, not just stale UI; the fix adds `generationQueue.ts`, queued turn rendering, active-job-preserving trimming, and active-remove-as-cancel so only one generation request runs at a time.
- Current multi-image evidence: `n=2` was already sent and recorded, but the active GPT gateway returned one image; backend now compensates by requesting the missing remainder.
- Watch out for: `outputs/`, `config.local.json`, `.runtime/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `__pycache__/`, `studio-web/node_modules/`, generated screenshots, and temporary zip files must remain out of commits and sync packages.
- White-screen startup note: if the backend is already running, `start_web.ps1` must validate the root page JS/CSS assets, not just `/api/health`, because an old in-memory backend can read new `index.html` but lack the new `/assets` mount.
- Sync note: the G: destination should receive source, built static assets, launcher scripts, docs, tests, and vendor runtime files, but not local-only runtime/config/output data. Do not sync internal ledger files `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`, or `DECISIONS.md`. Old `web_imagen_tool/` and `web_imagen_tool.zip` should remain untouched.
- Package note: only versioned zips such as `NM_web_imagen-v1.0.3.zip` are synced now. The existing unversioned `NM_web_imagen.zip` in the share root is left untouched for the user to delete later.
- One-click release note: double-click `一键发布.bat` or run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\release_one_click.ps1`.
- AGENTS note: `AGENTS.md` has stale snapshot wording, but it explicitly says not to edit it unless the user asks.
- Compatibility note: new `config.local.json` saves must continue writing legacy `forms` beside `profiles`; old configs with only `forms` must still load and receive URL-derived default profile names.

## v1.0.3 Confirmed
- [x] Config profiles: save multiple API/model configurations, support switching, editing, renaming, deleting, and marking a default/active profile.
- [x] Queue: image generation submits as a job instead of blocking the whole workbench; show pending/running/done/failed states.
- [x] Queue job controls: cancel, retry, duplicate/apply parameters, remove item, clear completed.
- [x] Diagnostics: minimal check for generation and chat separately, including clear warning when only one side works.
- [x] Non-blocking use: users can edit prompts and submit more work while image jobs run; browser smoke uses a mocked image endpoint so no paid upstream call is made.
- [x] UI polish: queue capsule/popover/row material, prompt-derived titles, preview actions, and resizable queue popover are implemented.

## v1.0.3 Suggested Additions
- [x] Queue persistence decision: keep queue metadata browser-local; refresh preserves finished jobs and marks queued/running jobs canceled instead of pretending HTTP requests survived.
- [x] Session/reference boundary: submitted jobs snapshot references at submit time; active jobs now block session deletion/clear, and orphan queue actions are guarded. Unsubmitted composer references remain global by existing decision.
- [x] Diagnostics detail: show endpoint, model, latency, capability result, and sanitized error; never log or expose API keys.
- [x] Current config entry display: show a custom profile name when set, otherwise a shortened URL-derived name without protocol/common suffixes, and make the entry clearly look clickable/editable.
- [ ] About/version panel: show current version, release/build info, and copyable diagnostics for another computer.
- [x] Release preflight script: verify `VERSION`, Studio assets, package exclusions, and G: sync readiness.

## Later
- [ ] If the user confirms, add a compact `图片库` trigger beside the composer reference button. Open a non-modal image tray with `本会话 / 最近历史 / 收藏` tabs, quick preview/reference/favorite actions, and a footer link to the full history window; use a bottom sheet on narrow screens instead of a permanent right rail.
- [ ] Next version: change history "套用参数" so missing `context_prompt / negative_prompt / poster_text` fields do not clear the current session prompt drafts; only explicit history fields should overwrite.
- [ ] Next version: reconsider chat-mode helper text. Current behavior calls the chat API but does not generate images; wording should not imply it is purely local/offline.
- [ ] Next version: broaden `.svnignore` to match the package-clean exclusions for `.playwright-mcp`, `studio-web/node_modules`, `studio-web/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, root screenshots/images, and related local artifacts.
- [ ] Decide whether `/classic` should remain long term or be retired in a separate cleanup phase.
- [ ] Consider adding a compact filter/search inside the persistent left history sidebar if history grows large.
- [ ] Consider adding a current-session export/import if Studio conversations need to move between machines.

## History
