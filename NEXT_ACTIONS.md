# Next Actions

## Now
- [x] Approved the v1.0.6 design/plan, created isolated branch `codex/p1-hardening-v1.0.6`, and verified the v1.0.5 baseline (backend 44/44, frontend 61/61, TypeScript, size rules).
- [x] Execute and independently review Tasks 1-3: local/image security boundaries, truthful browser behavior, cancellable bounded upstream work, atomic persistence, and revision-bound session merging.
- [x] Execute and independently review Task 4: PowerShell 5.1 UTF-8 BOM, runtime fingerprint and instance ID, exact-manifest packaging, extracted-package smoke, native failure short-circuiting, and local-before-G release order.
- [x] Execute and independently review Task 5: bump to 1.0.6, pass the full local release/API/browser matrix, sync the clean package, and verify the G: destination.
- [ ] Run final whole-branch review against the approved P1 spec/plan and resolve every Critical/Important finding.
- [ ] Use `finishing-a-development-branch` to present merge, PR, keep, or discard options; do not push or merge without the user's choice.

## Handoff Notes
- Start here: final whole-branch review at verified HEAD `120c3d4` in worktree `C:\Users\mumengfei\.config\superpowers\worktrees\NM_web_imagen\p1-hardening-v1.0.6`.
- Do not redo: P1 audit, design, plan, worktree setup, or Tasks 1-5 implementation/reviews. Latest controller evidence is Python 176/176, Node 97/97, compile/size/build PASS, exact 52-file package, package smoke, LocalOnly, API/Playwright smoke, G sync, and destination preflight.
- Verify next: review the complete branch diff against `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-p1-hardening-v1.0.6-design.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-p1-hardening-v1.0.6.md`; if clean, invoke `finishing-a-development-branch` and present integration choices.
- Do not claim: branch merge, push, tag, pull request, GitHub Release, or deletion/cleanup of the worktree/branch has occurred.
- Release boundary: if review changes any packaged file, rebuild/package/smoke/preflight/browser and resync G before restoring the verified-release claim.
- Known limits: cancellation cannot guarantee provider-side stop/refund after acceptance; locks and JobRegistry are single-process; chat remains text-only; session concurrency is file-based with one automatic merge retry; a Windows file lock lasting beyond bounded retry still surfaces as an error. Exact-manifest validation exists in three scripts; the exact-version test name is stale; informational OpenAPI/README version literals are non-authoritative; package smoke lacks an explicit expected-version parameter.

## Prior Release Context
- Historical start point: `I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen`, branch `main`.
- Synced copy on this machine: `G:\doc\Tools\AI产出工具插件\美术\特效组\网页生图工具\NM_web_imagen`.
- Current v1.0.5 packages: local `I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen-v1.0.5.zip`, share `G:\doc\Tools\AI产出工具插件\美术\特效组\网页生图工具\NM_web_imagen-v1.0.5.zip`, SHA256 `7c8e671fb1c00141243cd84427b0c202e9e2be9e8ef23d9537c93787fbe77109`.
- GitHub Release: `https://github.com/Cherofre/NM_web_imagen/releases/tag/v1.0.5`.
- Do not redo: Studio frontend scaffold, `/classic` fallback, real chat endpoints, backend Studio session persistence, GPT chat-model controls, reference snapshot display, and user-turn action buttons are already implemented and committed.
- Verify next after changes:
  - `python "C:\Users\mumengfei\.cc-switch\skills\project-ledger-loop\scripts\check_ledger.py" "I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen"`
  - `git status --short --branch`
- Do not claim: v1.0.5 feature branch was deleted locally or remotely; it is preserved for now.
- Current review evidence: final one-click release passed on `main` on 2026-06-26 17:33 +08:00; local and G: zips share SHA256 `7c8e671fb1c00141243cd84427b0c202e9e2be9e8ef23d9537c93787fbe77109`; final post-fix subagent Important finding is fixed.
- Current queue bug evidence: the stuck second task was a real upstream request that eventually timed out, not just stale UI; the fix adds `generationQueue.ts`, queued turn rendering, active-job-preserving trimming, and active-remove-as-cancel so only one generation request runs at a time.
- Current multi-image evidence: `n=2` was already sent and recorded, but the active GPT gateway returned one image; backend now compensates by requesting the missing remainder.
- Watch out for: `outputs/`, `config.local.json`, `.runtime/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `__pycache__/`, `studio-web/node_modules/`, generated screenshots, and temporary zip files must remain out of commits and sync packages.
- White-screen startup note: if the backend is already running, `start_web.ps1` must validate the root page JS/CSS assets, not just `/api/health`, because an old in-memory backend can read new `index.html` but lack the new `/assets` mount.
- Sync note: the G: destination should receive source, built static assets, launcher scripts, docs, tests, and vendor runtime files, but not local-only runtime/config/output data. Do not sync internal ledger files `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`, or `DECISIONS.md`. Old `web_imagen_tool/` and `web_imagen_tool.zip` should remain untouched.
- Package note: only versioned zips such as `NM_web_imagen-v1.0.3.zip` are synced now. The existing unversioned `NM_web_imagen.zip` in the share root is left untouched for the user to delete later.
- One-click release note: double-click `一键发布.bat` or run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\release_one_click.ps1`.
- AGENTS note: `AGENTS.md` has stale snapshot wording, but it explicitly says not to edit it unless the user asks.
- Compatibility note: new `config.local.json` saves must continue writing legacy `forms` beside `profiles`; old configs with only `forms` must still load and receive URL-derived default profile names.

## v1.0.3 Confirmed
- [x] Config profiles: save multiple API/model configurations, support switching, editing, renaming, deleting, and marking a default/active profile.
- [x] Queue: image generation submits as a job instead of blocking the whole workbench; show pending/running/done/failed states.
- [x] Queue job controls: cancel, retry, duplicate/apply parameters, remove item, clear completed.
- [x] Diagnostics: minimal check for generation and chat separately, including clear warning when only one side works.
- [x] Non-blocking use: users can edit prompts and submit more work while image jobs run; browser smoke uses a mocked image endpoint so no paid upstream call is made.
- [x] UI polish: queue capsule/popover/row material, prompt-derived titles, preview actions, and resizable queue popover are implemented.

## v1.0.3 Suggested Additions
- [x] Queue persistence decision: keep queue metadata browser-local; refresh preserves finished jobs and marks queued/running jobs canceled instead of pretending HTTP requests survived.
- [x] Session/reference boundary: submitted jobs snapshot references at submit time; active jobs now block session deletion/clear, and orphan queue actions are guarded. Unsubmitted composer references remain global by existing decision.
- [x] Diagnostics detail: show endpoint, model, latency, capability result, and sanitized error; never log or expose API keys.
- [x] Current config entry display: show a custom profile name when set, otherwise a shortened URL-derived name without protocol/common suffixes, and make the entry clearly look clickable/editable.
- [ ] About/version panel: show current version, release/build info, and copyable diagnostics for another computer.
- [x] Release preflight script: verify `VERSION`, Studio assets, package exclusions, and G: sync readiness.

## Later
- [ ] Next version: change history "套用参数" so missing `context_prompt / negative_prompt / poster_text` fields do not clear the current session prompt drafts; only explicit history fields should overwrite.
- [ ] Next version: reconsider chat-mode helper text. Current behavior calls the chat API but does not generate images; wording should not imply it is purely local/offline.
- [ ] Next version: broaden `.svnignore` to match the package-clean exclusions for `.playwright-mcp`, `studio-web/node_modules`, `studio-web/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, root screenshots/images, and related local artifacts.
- [ ] Decide whether `/classic` should remain long term or be retired in a separate cleanup phase.
- [ ] Consider adding a compact filter/search inside the persistent left history sidebar if history grows large.
- [ ] Consider adding a current-session export/import if Studio conversations need to move between machines.

## History
- [x] 2026-05-03: User requested staged commits and asked whether Project Ledger Loop was active.
- [x] 2026-05-10: Implemented the Studio-inspired local workbench plan.
- [x] 2026-05-11: Added backend persistence/chat improvements and began staged repo cleanup.
