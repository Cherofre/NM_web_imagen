# Next Actions

## Now
- [x] Compare the local hard gate with OpenAI's documented ChatGPT/image-editing workflow, confirm specificity should be guidance rather than a syntax requirement, and add RED regressions for the formerly blocked broad prompt.
- [x] Remove frontend/backend semantic blocking, add compact neutral guidance plus a mask-specific placeholder, and keep technical validation unchanged.
- [x] Run 163 Node tests, 244 Python tests, four-module compile, size verification, production build and diff checks; restart `14261` on the new assets.
- [x] Review the first real `换一个物品` result. The request reached `/v1/images/edits` with the mask, but the windmill remained; compare it with the prior ice-cream result and identify weak replacement semantics as the cause.
- [x] Add a non-blocking model-chosen-object expansion that requires complete removal of the selected original and a visibly different replacement; keep it inside the single `/v1/images/edits` request, add focused regressions and pass 245 Python tests.
- [ ] Hard-refresh `http://127.0.0.1:14261/`, reuse the same mask and submit `换一个物品`; confirm the windmill is replaced by a visibly different object rather than redrawn.
- [x] Re-run 163 Node tests, 245 Python tests, size/compile checks, fast-forward the verified branch into local `main`, restart `14261`, and leave publishing actions untouched.

## Handoff Notes
- Start here: hard-refresh `14261`, reuse the windmill mask and submit the exact prompt `换一个物品`.
- Do not redo: mask-path diagnosis, the first paid comparison, official-doc comparison, RED reproduction, 163 Node tests, 245 Python tests, size/build checks or the `14261` restart.
- Do not add: a preliminary chat/Responses/vision request for mask-intent parsing. Keep the solution single-call.
- Verify next: the hint remains non-blocking, the queued turn retains its mask snapshot/guidance badge, and the generated result fully replaces the windmill with a visibly different object while keeping the dog's grip natural.
- Do not claim: the strengthened prompt has passed a second paid upstream result, manual browser acceptance, package/G: sync, push, tag or Release.
- Release boundary: v1.0.8 remains the published baseline. The follow-up is merged only into local `main`, which is four commits ahead of `origin/main` after the integration-status record.
- Current Studio assets: `index-B2GPwNFn.js` and `index-BWB4gA76.css`; live `14261` PID `63964`.
- Known limits: soft guidance does not make a broad prompt deterministic; mask guidance remains prompt-based and can drift slightly outside the selected region.

## Prior Release Context
- Historical start point: `I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen`, branch `main`.
- Synced copy on this machine: `G:\doc\Tools\AI产出工具插件\美术\特效组\网页生图工具\NM_web_imagen`.
- Current v1.0.5 packages: local `I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen-v1.0.5.zip`, share `G:\doc\Tools\AI产出工具插件\美术\特效组\网页生图工具\NM_web_imagen-v1.0.5.zip`, SHA256 `7c8e671fb1c00141243cd84427b0c202e9e2be9e8ef23d9537c93787fbe77109`.
- GitHub Release: `https://github.com/Cherofre/NM_web_imagen/releases/tag/v1.0.5`.
- Do not redo: Studio frontend scaffold, `/classic` fallback, real chat endpoints, backend Studio session persistence, GPT chat-model controls, reference snapshot display, and user-turn action buttons are already implemented and committed.
- Verify next after changes:
  - `python "C:\Users\mumengfei\.cc-switch\skills\project-ledger-loop\scripts\check_ledger.py" "I:\AI\Vibe Coding\NM_web_imagen"`
  - `git status --short --branch`
- Do not claim: v1.0.5 feature branch was deleted locally or remotely; it is preserved for now.
- Current review evidence: final one-click release passed on `main` on 2026-06-26 17:33 +08:00; local and G: zips share SHA256 `7c8e671fb1c00141243cd84427b0c202e9e2be9e8ef23d9537c93787fbe77109`; final post-fix subagent Important finding is fixed.
- Current queue bug evidence: the stuck second task was a real upstream request that eventually timed out, not just stale UI; the fix adds `generationQueue.ts`, queued turn rendering, active-job-preserving trimming, and active-remove-as-cancel so only one generation request runs at a time.
- Current multi-image evidence: `n=2` was already sent and recorded, but the active GPT gateway returned one image; backend now compensates by requesting the missing remainder.
- Watch out for: `outputs/`, `config.local.json`, `.runtime/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, `__pycache__/`, `studio-web/node_modules/`, generated screenshots, and temporary zip files must remain out of commits and sync packages.
- White-screen startup note: if the backend is already running, `start_web.ps1` must validate the root page JS/CSS assets, not just `/api/health`, because an old in-memory backend can read new `index.html` but lack the new `/assets` mount.
- Sync note: the G: destination should receive source, built static assets, launcher scripts, docs, tests, and vendor runtime files, but not local-only runtime/config/output data. Do not sync internal ledger files `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`, or `DECISIONS.md`. Old `web_imagen_tool/` and `web_imagen_tool.zip` should remain untouched.
- Package note: only versioned zips such as `NM_web_imagen-v1.0.3.zip` are synced now. The existing unversioned `NM_web_imagen.zip` in the share root is left untouched for the user to delete later.
- One-click release note: double-click `一键发布.bat` or run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\release_one_click.ps1`.
- AGENTS note: `AGENTS.md` has stale snapshot wording, but it explicitly says not to edit it unless the user asks.
- Compatibility note: new `config.local.json` saves must continue writing legacy `forms` beside `profiles`; old configs with only `forms` must still load and receive URL-derived default profile names.

## v1.0.3 Confirmed
- [x] Config profiles: save multiple API/model configurations, support switching, editing, renaming, deleting, and marking a default/active profile.
- [x] Queue: image generation submits as a job instead of blocking the whole workbench; show pending/running/done/failed states.
- [x] Queue job controls: cancel, retry, duplicate/apply parameters, remove item, clear completed.
- [x] Diagnostics: minimal check for generation and chat separately, including clear warning when only one side works.
- [x] Non-blocking use: users can edit prompts and submit more work while image jobs run; browser smoke uses a mocked image endpoint so no paid upstream call is made.
- [x] UI polish: queue capsule/popover/row material, prompt-derived titles, preview actions, and resizable queue popover are implemented.

## v1.0.3 Suggested Additions
- [x] Queue persistence decision: keep queue metadata browser-local; refresh preserves finished jobs and marks queued/running jobs canceled instead of pretending HTTP requests survived.
- [x] Session/reference boundary: submitted jobs snapshot references at submit time; active jobs now block session deletion/clear, and orphan queue actions are guarded. Unsubmitted composer references remain global by existing decision.
- [x] Diagnostics detail: show endpoint, model, latency, capability result, and sanitized error; never log or expose API keys.
- [x] Current config entry display: show a custom profile name when set, otherwise a shortened URL-derived name without protocol/common suffixes, and make the entry clearly look clickable/editable.
- [ ] About/version panel: show current version, release/build info, and copyable diagnostics for another computer.
- [x] Release preflight script: verify `VERSION`, Studio assets, package exclusions, and G: sync readiness.

## Later
- [ ] If the user confirms, add a compact `图片库` trigger beside the composer reference button. Open a non-modal image tray with `本会话 / 最近历史 / 收藏` tabs, quick preview/reference/favorite actions, and a footer link to the full history window; use a bottom sheet on narrow screens instead of a permanent right rail.
- [ ] Next version: change history "套用参数" so missing `context_prompt / negative_prompt / poster_text` fields do not clear the current session prompt drafts; only explicit history fields should overwrite.
- [ ] Next version: reconsider chat-mode helper text. Current behavior calls the chat API but does not generate images; wording should not imply it is purely local/offline.
- [ ] Next version: broaden `.svnignore` to match the package-clean exclusions for `.playwright-mcp`, `studio-web/node_modules`, `studio-web/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, root screenshots/images, and related local artifacts.
- [ ] Decide whether `/classic` should remain long term or be retired in a separate cleanup phase.
- [ ] Consider adding a compact filter/search inside the persistent left history sidebar if history grows large.
- [ ] Consider adding a current-session export/import if Studio conversations need to move between machines.
